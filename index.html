  <h2>Stefanos' Biography</h2>
  <div id="bio-flexbox">
    <div>
      <h4>1. BEGINNING OF HIS LIFE</h4>
      <p>
        Stefanos was born in Athens, Greece at 12th of August 1998 to a Greek father from Karditsa, Greece and a Russian
        mother from Moscow, Russia. These two people were the first ones to introduce him to tennis. It all started at
        the tennis courts of a local resort in which both of his parents worked as tennis coaches for tourists and
        travelers. That was the place where he picked up his first tennis racket and learnt all the secrets of this
        wonderful sport.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was the first child out of four in the family. They lived in a touristic suburb south of Athens called
        Vouliagmeni with a population of less than 6,000 people. The suburb is named after
        <a href="https://www.limnivouliagmenis.gr/">Lake Vouliagmeni</a>, located in its vicinity.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>2. GETTING STARTED WITH TENNIS</h4>
      <p>At the the age of six Stefanos started having his first tennis lessons at the Tennis Club Glifada in a group
        with other kids at his age. His first coach was Giorgos Spiliopoulos who taught him about the importance of the
        sport, discipline, work-ethic and right technique on court. It was a very important step having a humble coach
        like Giorgos giving him the right steps and directing him with his knowledge from the beginning of time.
      </p>
      <p>At the age of eight he moved to Giorgos Fountoukos, the person who developed his game, technique, footwork as a
        junior player. Giorgos Fountoukos was a big change in Stefanos' tennis since then, he is a very experienced
        tennis coach with lot’s of on-court knowledge, a very conventional way of technique development and a unique
        cast of mind on the tennis court. He is his tennis coach back home until today.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>3. UNDERSTANDING HIS LIFE THROUGH TENNIS</h4>
      <p>After getting started with the game of tennis there was a crucial decision that he had to make, a decision that
        was getting closer as the years went by. This decision was his future. Does he want to make tennis his
        profession? Is he ready to sacrifice his life in Greece to begin traveling for tennis? The answer from his 12
        year old self was <q>Yes, I want to do that.</q>
      </p>
      <p>He was ready for this long journey, this battle that he had to face, the stress, the sleepless nights, the
        tension, the frustration, the nerves, the anxiety… He had to face an opponent, but the biggest challenge was to
        surpass his expectations. He was going to take his chances, fail most of the time but, that was and still is the
        key on growing successfully and chasing a dream that was and is there. Titles that many people want, but only
        few get.
      </p>
      <p>Tennis taught him a lot of things in his life. He has experienced things that he wouldn't otherwise experience
        if he wasn't playing the sport that he loves. Tennis allowed him to see new places, meet new people, discover
        cultures... He was able to turn his childhood hobby into hs profession. That was incredible already!
      </p>
      <p>Tennis has taught him of discipline, self-awareness, behaviour, morality, respect, sportsmanship and
        decision-making. He owns everything to this game, a game with which he has grown, learned and failed most of the
        time. Tennis represents him and everything that he has. Tennis is always going to be his job and his passion.
        Tennis is his life!</p>
